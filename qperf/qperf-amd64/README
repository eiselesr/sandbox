To build
    ./cleanup
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

Changing version
    * src/qperf.c: Change VER_MAJ, VER_MIN and VER_INC.
    * configure.in: Change in AC_INIT and AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
    * qperf.spec: Change line beginning with Version:
    * Note ensure that qperf.spec is modified last so that cleanup does not
      delete it.

Notes
    * If the library ibverbs is not found, a version of qperf is built that
      does not support the RDMA tests.
    * Running "make clean" does not seem to clean up everything.  Run
      "./cleanup" instead.
